Hello! I‚Äôm Zhongcheng Zhang(Âº†Âø†ËØö), a phd student at the [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), advised by Prof. [Xiaobing Feng](http://www.ict.ac.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496613.html). And I am lucky to work with and advised by Prof. [Ying Liu](http://www.ict.ac.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/202201/t20220111_6338879.html) and [Jingling Xue](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~jingling/).

My research interest includes compiler and computer architecture. Recently, I am focusing on **Fully Homomorphic Encryption(FHE) compilers**.
