Hello! I‚Äôm Zhongcheng Zhang, a phd student at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences,advised by Prof. Xiaobing Feng. And I am lucky to work with and advised by Prof. Ying Liu and Jingling Xue.

My research interest includes compiler and computer architecture. Recently, I am focusing on Fully Homomorphic Encryption(FHE) compilers.
